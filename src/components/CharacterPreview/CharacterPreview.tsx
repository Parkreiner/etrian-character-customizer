         * Extra container with absolute positioning is necessary to avoid
         * unexpected behavior with ResizeObserver callback.
         *
         * Basically:
         * 1. The canvas is supposed to fit itself to the container
         * 2. But since the canvas can't have CSS properties on it without the
         *    risk of warping the image, you can't tell it to make its size
         *    dependent on its parent
         * 3. Because of this, the container will be allowed to grow (and the
         *    canvas will grow to match it), but it won't be allowed to shrink,
         *    because then it would be cutting off the canvas.
         * 4. Because the container is only allowed to grow, the resizer
         *    callback only runs when you grow the container. It will never run
         *    when you shrink it.
         * 5. The only fix is to remove the element from the flow, but you can't
         *    do the size changes on the canvas itself â€“ because again, it might
         *    warp.
