/**
 * 2023-04-29 - Ran into a glitch with React itself, based around useRef. For
 * some reason, after the callback ref ran, all refs in this component started
 * to get really screwy when you accessed their values. The div with
 * containerRef would spit out errors about both ref and key not being valid
 * props that you can access. There aren't any keys in this component, though,
 * and the refs obviously exist. The thing also is, the div for the container
 * ref isn't really accessed anywhere, yet that was where all the complaints
 * were coming from (presumably because it was the first ref attached?).
 *
 * The access glitch was so bad that even just logging the current values (not
 * doing anything else with them) caused errors in the console.
 *
 * Need to see if I can replicate this.
