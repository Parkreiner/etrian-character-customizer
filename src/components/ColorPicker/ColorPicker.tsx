/**
 * @file A component that lets you pick colors via RGB or HSV.
 *
 * Chose to use HSV instead of HSL because it's more intuitive to someone who's
 * used a lot of Adobe products (even though only HSL is supported by CSS).
 *
 * The rest of the app is using hex codes to make working with colors easier.
 * This is the only top-level component that needs to be aware of the RGB and
 * HSV formats. However, RGB->HSV and HSV->RGB are both lossy formulas, and the
 * numbers can sometimes do weird things, which, when you have controlled inputs
 * bound to the numbers, can make them also do weird things. The HSV values had
 * to be separated into state to keep the UI feeling nice and not janky.
 *
 * Notable UI jank caused by the formulas:
 * - Anytime saturation goes to 0, hue is also supposed to be 0. But having hue
 *   change because you were changing a different channel felt weird. Hue would
 *   also be forever stuck at 0 in the UI until you added saturation back.
 * - Because HSV->RGB/Hex is lossy, there would be cases (especially for the
 *   brighter colors) where you would change something in the HSV inputs, which
 *   would make a new HSV object. The HSV would then be converted to hex, and
 *   the hex would be passed to onHexChange. But the new hex string would be the
 *   same as the old hex string, and so nothing would re-render. The only way to
 *   get the UI unstuck was by changing a V value or an RGB value.
